- P(stock go up) = 0.6 = p
- P(stock go down) = 0.4
- Standard devidation = $ σ = \sqrt{p*(1-p)} = \sqrt{0.6*(1-0.6)} = \sqrt{0.6*0.4} = \sqrt{0.24} = 0.48989 ≈ 0.49  $

# Question 6
- Binomial distribution:
    - n = 4
    - x = 2
    - p = 0.6
- $ P(X=x) = \binom{n}{x}p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x} $
- $ P(X=2) = \binom{4}{2}(0.6)^{2}(1-0.6)^{4-2} $
- $ P(X=2) = \binom{4}{2}(0.6)^{2}(0.4)^{2} $
- $ P(X=2) = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} * 0.36 * 0.16 $
- $ P(X=2) = \frac{4!}{2!2!} * 0.36 * 0.16 $
- $ P(X=2) = \frac{24}{4} * 0.36 * 0.16 $
- $ P(X=2) = 6 * 0.36 * 0.16 $
- $ P(X=2) = 0.3456 $

# Question 8
- mean = μ = 30,000
- standard deviation  = σ = ?
- 95% = the range between μ-2σ and μ+2σ = between 20,000 and 40,000
- Therefore:
    - μ-2σ = 20,000
    - μ+2σ = 40,000
- From 2 equations above => σ = 5,000

# Question 9
- We know μ = 30,000
- Base of Empirical Rule:
    - The range between μ-σ and μ+σ = 68% = 25,000 to 35,000
    - The range between μ-2σ and μ+2σ = 95% = 20,000 to 40,000
    - The range between μ-3σ and μ+3σ = 99.7% = 15,000 to 45,000
- Probability of a random driver gets more than 25,000 miles?
    - P(25,000 or more) = The area between μ-σ and μ+3σ = ?
    - The area between μ-3σ and μ-2σ = $ \frac{99.7 - 95}{2} = 2.35 $
    - The area between μ-2σ and μ-σ = $ \frac{95 - 68}{2} = 13.5 $
- The area between μ-σ and μ+3σ = $ 99.7 - 2.35 - 13.5 = 83.85 ≈ 84 $
- P(25,000 or more) = 84% = 0.84
